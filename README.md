## Task
Dataset: Parkinsons Telemonitoring Data Set

## Aim:
- Students should provide the best possible regression and classification models using Decision Trees and Linear models
- Models should examine different hyperparameters and select the best one [Remember: everything else being similar, the simplest models should be prefered]
- It is expected a full testing and validation cycle of model selection and evaluation

## Objective 1
Produce the best regression model for 'motor UPDRS'
the variable total UPRDS must obviously not be used as an independent variable

## Objective 2
Produce the best binary classification model assuming as positive all instances with values of total_UPRDS> 40 and as negatives all remaining cases
the variables total UPRDS and motor UPRDS must obviously not be used as independent variables
